# Python script "Extract from Sberbank for several cards in Excel"

# Introduction
I wrote this script because I wanted to analyze my budget in Excel.
I also wrote a script that divides an Excel file into sheets into several files.
I know it looks terrible... The main thing is working! :)

# Description
The following libraries are used in the work of this bot:
1. fitz (PyMuPDF)
2. os
3. openpyxl
4. sys

To run the script, save your card statements to the script folder, having previously numbered them with numbers from 1 to 9.
